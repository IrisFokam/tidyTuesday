# tidyTuesday
- The first file "tidytuesday_one" uses the tidy T. data from a survey collected from Stack Overflow members. In this tidy I observe how number of coding years of the participants relate to their Stack Overflow participation frequency. 
- The second tidy is from a Valentine's day survey data from the National Retail Federation in the US. In this tidy I look at how different popular gifts on valentine's day lose or gain popularity over the years.
- The third one is from the UK office for National Statistics, about the education level of different towns, along with other features of the towns education. In this tidy I focus on how education levels has affected the distribution of the working and non-working population, for the different town sizes.
